Jordan's thoughts of things we need to do:





For the actor class (and the die function) we need to be able to
get the respawn points from the level and then set the x and y to
them instead of having it be up top.


I also need to fix the animation functions for actor


Fade in/out

torches

levels


tiles that you can jump through



double jump
spike immunity
become an ostrich
get weapon
	- several
get hats
	- tophat
	- flying hat
	- cowboy?
	- turban?
raining ______ (no collision box?)
	- several?
walked backwards? (the theme was backwards)
low gravity?
faster running
more health
	- full health
	- to enemies
	- expand healthbar?
ostriches were harder




restart game
	- with no genies
quit game


Things to do:
Add the textbox for the genie speaking

Add the jump leniency
